Assemble Boilerplate
===========

Based on https://github.com/assemble/assemble-pattern-lab by Jon Schlinkert

Workflow:
- add component (.hbs)
- add component based .scss-file
- include .scss-file into app.scss
- include component into styleguide's config.json
- run grunt assemble-it

Important:
- Don't use camel-case for handlebars or filenames
